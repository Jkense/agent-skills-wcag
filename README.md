# WCAG Agent Skills

A set of [WCAG agent skills](https://agentskills.io/home) for LLMs. These skills are packaged instructions and scripts that extend agent capabilities, helping ensure compliance with [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) and [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) guidelines.

Skills are automatically available once installed. The agent will use them when relevant tasks are detected.
